			<div class="col-sm-1"></div>
			
			<div class="col-sm-5">
				<p>I like challenging work. I attended <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a> for two years while enrolled in the five-year dual-degree program for Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. During the Fall of my Sophomore year, I enjoyed <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/blog/adoseoflondon" target="_blank">studying abroad in London</a>. While in London I planned volunteer events throughout London and Wales.</p>

				<p>I adapt well to change. I transferred to <a href="https://www.southwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Southwestern University</a> after completing my Sophomore year. For my capstone project, I worked with eleven other students to build a <a href="https://github.com/SUDrAnthonyCourses/Capstone2015" target="_blank">web application</a> with Ruby on Rails. I graduated in 2015 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-5">
			<p>I have a knack for languages (not just the programming ones). I have learned Spanish (a few semesters in college) and Italian (self-study for a year) in the past and <a href="https://www.italki.com/user/3347652" target="_blank">currently study Brazilian-Portuguese</a>.</p>

			<p>I take classes and teach myself a lot of things. I learned archery in London. I have taught myself piano, juggling and knitting.</p>

			<p>I enjoy traveling and learning about new cultures. In the past I have lived and worked on both coasts of the US in the Silicon Valley, New York City, Dallas and Washington DC to name a few. Outside of the United States, I have traveled to England, Wales, Spain, France and Portugal.</p>
