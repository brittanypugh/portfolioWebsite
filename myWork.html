            <h4>New to the Area</h4>
            <p>You recently moved to the DC area. Luckily, you found a friend who is ready to help you figure out the area. As a friendly gesture, they invite you to their Saturday potluck. It is Friday afternoon. Are you going to cook something?</p>
            <button id="btn1a">Cook Something</button>
            <button id="btn1b">Buy Something</button></div>

            <h4>Nervous About Cooking</h4>
            <p>You are reasonably confident that you can cook something edible. What do you decide to make?</p>
            <p><input type="submit" name="choice 2a" id="btn2a" value="Salad"></p>
            <p><input type="submit" name="choice 2b" id="btn2b" value="Cupcakes"></p></div>

            <h4>Took the Easy Way</h4>
            <p>You decide to head to the store to buy something. How will you get there?</p>
            <p><input type="submit" name="choice 2c" id="btn2c" value="Public Transportation"></p>
            <p><input type="submit" name="choice 2d" id="btn2d" value="Car"></p></div>

            <h4>Everyone Loves Salad</h4>
            <p>You don't have all the ingredients you need at home so you head to the store. How will you get there?</p>

            <h4>Public Transportation is Great, Right?</h4>
            <p>You forgot about the metro delays. You wait 25 minutes for the Yellow train to come and transfer to the Blue line. Eventually, you make it to the store. </p></div>
        
        <div class="choice" id="choice2d">
            <h4>Traffic Should Be Light, Right?</h4>
            <p>You didn't think about traffic. You didn't think about the agressive East Coast drivers. You miss the same exit after hitting a roundabout for the third time. But, you make it to the store. </p></div>
