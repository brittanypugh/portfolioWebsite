            <h4>New to the Area</h4>
            <p>You recently moved to the DC area. Luckily, you found a friend who is ready to help you figure out the area. As a friendly gesture, they invite you to their Saturday potluck. It is Friday afternoon. Are you going to cook something?</p></div>
        <div id="choice1a">
            <h4>Nervous About Cooking</h4>
            <p>You are reasonably confident that you can cook something edible. What do you decide to make?</p></div>
        <div id="choice1b">
            <h4>Took the Easy Way</h4>
            <p>You decide to head to the store to buy something. How will you get there?</p></div>
        <div id="choice2a">
            <h4>Everyone Loves Cookies</h4>
            <p>You don't have all the ingredients you need at home so you head to the store. How will you get there?</p></div>
        <div id="choice2b">
            <h4>Everyone Loves Chili</h4>
            <p>You don't have all the ingredients you need at home so you head to the store. How will you get there?</p></div>
        <div id="choice2c">
            <h4>Public Transportation is Great, Right?</h4>
            <p>You forgot about the metro delays. The next train won't come for 25 minutes and you'll need to transfer to another line. Do you want to wait for the next train?</p></div>
        <div id="choice2d">
            <h4>I Love My Car</h4>
            <p>You didn't think about traffic. You didn't think about the agressive East Coast drivers. Time is running out. Do you want to wait it out in the traffic?</p></div>
